# Dotnet API with Graphql using [GraphQL.NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet)
* Code splitting.
* Data Loader implementation.

ðŸ“£ *This is a self study project to allow me to better understand the `GraphQL` in the `.Net` environment and **not** a production ready API.*

ðŸ‘‰The `RootQuery` and `RootMutation` are ***partial classes*** and the *queries* and *mutations* of the `Owner` and `Account` are an extension of them. By doing that we are improving our code organization.
The [GraphQL .NET](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/query-organization) documentation explain how to do code organization in a different way, but the final result is a messy schema with queries and mutation aggregated by *entity*.
